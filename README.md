# ComputerVision
This is for coding some algorithms both in classes and after, both conventional and deep learning.

#### project 1

project 1's tasks lie on how to use low pass and high pass filter on different pictures and then merge different handled figures into one picture and then down-sampling !

#### project 3

project 3 is purposed on the how to make features selections and classifications on different pictures.

The main flow paths are as follows:

1. preprocessing figures
2. getting SIFT features
3. K-means cluster algorithm
4. getting BOW(Bag of words) model
5. SVM/KNN classification algorithm
