% CSCI 1430 Written Question Template
%
% This is a LaTeX document. LaTeX is a markup language for producing documents.
% Your task is to answer the questions by filling out this document, then to
% compile this into a PDF document.
% You will then upload this PDF to `Gradescope' - the grading system that we will use.
% Instructions for upload will follow soon.
%
%
% TO COMPILE:
% > pdflatex thisfile.tex
%
% If you do not have LaTeX and need a LaTeX distribution:
% - Departmental machines have one installed.
% - Personal laptops (all common OS): http://www.latex-project.org/get/
%
% If you need help with LaTeX, come to office hours. Or, there is plenty of help online:
% https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX
%
% Good luck!

\section*{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 4 questions.
  \item Write code where appropriate.
  \item Feel free to include images or equations.
  \item Please make this document anonymous.
  \item On upload, \textbf{Gradescope will ask you to assign question numbers to your pages}. Making each question end with a page break after your answer is a good way to ease this process.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}

\paragraph{Q1:} Explicitly describe image convolution: the input, the transformation, and the output. Why is it useful for computer vision?

\paragraph{Q2:} What is the difference between convolution and correlation? Construct a scenario which produces a different output between both operations.

\emph{Please use \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.convolve.html}{$scipy.ndimage.convolve$} and \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.correlate.html}{$scipy.ndimage.correlate$} to experiment!}

\paragraph{Q3:} What is the difference between a high pass filter and a low pass filter in how they are constructed, and what they do to the image? Please provide example kernels and output images.

\paragraph{Q4:} How does computation time vary with filter sizes from $3\times3$ to $15\times15$ (for all odd and square sizes), and with image sizes from 0.25~MPix to 8~MPix (choose your own intervals)? Measure both using \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.convolve.html}{$scipy.ndimage.convolve$} or \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.correlate.html}{$scipy.ndimage.correlate$} to produce a matrix of values. Use the \href{http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/transform/plot_rescale.html}{$skimage.transform$} module to vary the size of an image. Use an appropriate charting function to plot your matrix of results, such as \href{https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/toolkits/mplot3d.html#scatter-plots}{$Axes3D.scatter$} or \href{https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/toolkits/mplot3d.html#surface-plots}{$Axes3D.plot\textrm{\_}surface$}.

Do the results match your expectation given the number of multiply and add operations in convolution?
